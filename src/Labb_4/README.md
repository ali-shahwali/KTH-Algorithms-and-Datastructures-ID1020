#Lab: Graphs
###Programming assignments:
####Part 1: Undirected graphs 

For this part you should assume that the edges defined by the vertex pairs are two-way.

#####Write a program based on DFS which can answer questions of the type: "Find the a path from X to Y" Which should result in a list of vertices traversed from X to Y if there is a path.

#####Change the program to use BFS.

####Part 2: Directed graphs

For this part you should assume that the edges defined by the vertex pairs in the data base are one-way.

#####Write a program that can answer if there is a path between any to vertices.

###Assignment for higher grades
Implement a program which allows the user to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph possibly passing through a third node. I.e. the user should be able to ask questions like:
#####Which is the shortest path from A to B passing through C? 
#####The program should output an ordered list of the nodes to traverse from A to B if such a path exists. If no such path exists then the program should output that no such path exists.
