# Lab: Graphs
### Programming assignments:
#### Part 1: Undirected graphs 

For this part you should assume that the edges defined by the vertex pairs are two-way.

##### 1. Write a program based on DFS which can answer questions of the type: "Find the a path from X to Y" Which should result in a list of vertices traversed from X to Y if there is a path.

##### 2. Change the program to use BFS.

#### Part 2: Directed graphs

For this part you should assume that the edges defined by the vertex pairs in the data base are one-way.

##### 3. Write a program that can answer if there is a path between any to vertices.

### Assignment for higher grades
##### Implement a program which allows the user to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph possibly passing through a third node. I.e. the user should be able to ask questions like:
##### Which is the shortest path from A to B passing through C? 
The program should output an ordered list of the nodes to traverse from A to B if such a path exists. If no such path exists then the program should output that no such path exists.
